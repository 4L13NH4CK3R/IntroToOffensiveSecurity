## What is inside this Repo?  
I have went through all of the Rooms I can. And inside of these rooms, I have copied & pasted the content inside as well as the Questions & answers.  
Why did I do that?  
I did that so that I can push this to a repo on Github in order to reference them later, or help other people get through the challenges and help them enhance their hacking skills. But primary, so  
that I can have a reference point on GitHub so that if my computer is destroyed, I can rebuild and pull the contents from my GitHub account.
